Grey is one of the most universal colors for pants that matches almost any color of shoe. A bit formal for light grey trousers, dark brown shoes offer stark contrast. Red cotton pants and a casual grey shoe will look great together and provide you with a very unique look. In my opinion, you can wear grey shoes with khaki pants if you wear different shades (dark color shoes, light color pants, and vice versa).
